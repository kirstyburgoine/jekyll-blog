Yesterday I was witness to something very special indeed...

I went to UpFront Conf in Manchester, and while that was utterly awesome in its own right (separate write up coming soon), there was one very specific highlight that surpasses anything I’ve ever seen at a conference before. And that was Eric Meyer’s video address to the conference.

Eric sent an extremely moving video to Upfront. He talked about the loss of his daughter Rebecca and how the web industry showed their support by adopting the colour purple, because it was her favourite, on social media and even some websites changing their colour scheme for a day. 

This resulted in the proposal to get the named colour ‘rebeccapurple’ added to the CSS specification and was approved by the CSS WG on 21st June 2014.

Eric’s message to Upfront about this was:

> “We are not a web industry we are a web community" 

**This**.

This is such an important message and encapsulates everything I love about working in this industry. Its why I go to conferences, its why I go to meet ups, its why I have organised conferences, its why I still organise meet ups. Its all about supporting and growing this amazing community. It doesn’t matter what framework you use or what CMS system, whether you’re a full stack developer or digital marketer it doesn’t matter. Our community makes it possible for us to learn together, push each other to do better work, support each other in good and bad times and create a better web for the generations to follow. 

Its a phenomenal thing and not something I believe other industries have the opportunity to experience to the same degree.

Well done us :)

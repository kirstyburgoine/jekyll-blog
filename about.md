Hello!

This is a new blog for fun stuff and so I can mess around with code. YAY :)

I've never really done much with jekyll or Github pages before so this seemed a good way to play with those and still have a practical use for all the random thoughts and bits and bobs that have no place elsewhere.

* My old blog can still be found here: [Wordpress.com](https://kirstyburgoine.wordpress.com/)
* I write on the Fisheye Blog here: [Fisheye Blog](http://fisheye-webdesign.co.uk/insights/)
* And I have a CodePen that I'm starting to update more and more here: [CodePen](https://codepen.io/kirstyburgoine/) 

I've also written tutorials on WordPress for NetMag and various online blogs, I speak at conferences and meet ups from time to time on a range of subjects too.

Why not get in touch and have a chat :)
